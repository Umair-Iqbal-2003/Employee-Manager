Author: Umair Iqbal

Project Description
The Employee Bonus Calculator is a C++ program that calculates the bonus pay for a group of managers. It is built using two classes, the Employee class, and the Manager class. The Manager class is derived from the Employee class and includes additional functionality to calculate bonus pay.

Features

-Allows the user to input the details of multiple managers, including their names, hourly wages, hours worked, and bonuses. \n
-Calculates the total pay for each manager by combining their regular wage and bonus.
-Identifies the manager with the highest pay and displays their name and pay amount.
-Computes the average pay for all managers and displays the result.
-Properly manages memory by deallocating memory for Manager objects to prevent memory leaks.
